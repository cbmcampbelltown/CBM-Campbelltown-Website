Campus Bible Ministries (CBM) Campbelltown is a group of Christians studying at UWS Campbelltown who see the opportunities afforded them by their location to proclaim Jesus’ death and resurrection on campus. We gather around the Bible to hear God speak to us and in fellowship understand how what God’s says applies to our lives in ministry at UWS Campbelltown. We are a trans-denominational group of Christians who in love encourage, support, and disciple each other whilst studying.
