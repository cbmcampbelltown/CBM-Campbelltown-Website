These are the core beliefs of CBM Campbelltown:

- We believe that Jesus died bodily as a penal substitute to pay for sin. The Bible uses many ways, and many illustrations to explain that Jesus dies in place of his people in order to pay God’s just judgement for sin. (Mark 10:45, Rom 3:25, Gal 1:4, 1 Peter 2:24).
- We believe that Jesus did not stay dead, but rose bodily from the grave. Through the resurrection of Jesus, God has clearly demonstrated that he will judge all people through Jesus (Acts 17:31, Romans 1:1-6). We believe the Bible clearly teaches that the only way to escape God’s just judgement is through trusting in Jesus death and resurrection in our place (John 3:16-17).
- We believe all humanity rebelled against God and therefore worthy of punishment for this rebellion. The Bible uses the word ‘sin’ to describe man’s relationship to God and the permanent state humanity would live in if left to our own devices. (Luke 18:19, Romans 3:9-12)
- We believe the Bible is the Word of God. God has spoken to us through his Word to reveal to us God’s means of salvation (2 Tim 3:14-16). Though not all God’s word is easy to understand, God’s word is clear in the sense that it does not hide what God chooses humanity to know (2 Peter 3:16).

These are the core beliefs we believe as CBM Campbelltown. The implication of these beliefs is that we as Christians believe that we too are subject to sin and distort God’s word. But in humility we come to listen and learn from the Bible how God would have us live in the world whilst we wait the return of Jesus. We that we don’t understand everything the Bible says, and that we all have things to learn throughout our lives about God, ourselves the the way we relate to God and others.

None-the-less though we admit we don’t know everything, we do hold fast to the beliefs above as taught in God’s word. As God's people at UWS Campbelltown we hold forth the Word of Life in prayer that all people will come to trust in Jesus as Lord and Saviour.
