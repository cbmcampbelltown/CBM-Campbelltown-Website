Jesus said to them, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose” Luke 4:43
Jesus in Luke’s gospel makes very clear his purpose was to preach the gospel to the people of Israel. Jesus said this statement in the context of a doing many miracles and helping many people. Despite all the good things Jesus was doing for people, His priority was that people know the forgiveness of sins freely offered by God and the great news of God’s Kingdom found in Him.

No one person can do this alone. CBM Campbelltown is a group of studying Christians placed at UWS Campbelltown by God who see the campus as a mission field. Understanding the urgency and priority of the mission, students enter in partnership to proclaim salvation through faith in Jesus Christ to UWS Campbelltown.

Our vision is to faithfully present the good news of God’s Kingdom in love to every student at UWS Campbelltown.
The mission of CBM Campbelltown is to evangelise every student on campus with the gospel, and in doing this to create structures capable of ministering to 100 students in partnership who have a common goal of preaching the gospel to UWS Campbelltown with 10 student Bible Study leaders, 20 students reading the Bible one-to-one and 10 people a year coming to know Jesus.
